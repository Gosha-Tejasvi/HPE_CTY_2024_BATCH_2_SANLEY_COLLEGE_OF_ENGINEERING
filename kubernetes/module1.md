# Using Minikube to Create a Kubernetes Cluster

## Objectives

- Learn what a Kubernetes cluster is.
- Learn what Minikube is.
- Start a Kubernetes cluster on your computer.

## Kubernetes Clusters

Kubernetes coordinates a highly available cluster of computers that are connected to work as a single unit. The abstractions in Kubernetes allow you to deploy containerized applications to a cluster without tying them specifically to individual machines. Kubernetes automates the distribution and scheduling of application containers across a cluster in an efficient way.

### Components of a Kubernetes Cluster

A Kubernetes cluster consists of two main types of resources:

- **Control Plane**: Manages the cluster and its nodes. It coordinates all activities such as scheduling applications, maintaining their desired state, scaling, and rolling out updates.
- **Nodes**: Worker machines where applications run. Each node has a Kubelet agent that manages the node and communicates with the Kubernetes control plane.

### Minikube Overview

Minikube is a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple Kubernetes cluster with a single node. It's ideal for development and testing purposes.

- **Supported Platforms**: Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **Minikube CLI**: Provides commands to manage your local Kubernetes cluster, including start, stop, status, and delete.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (Kubernetes command-line tool) installed.
- A hypervisor (such as VirtualBox, HyperKit, or KVM) depending on your operating system for Minikube to run a virtual machine.

### Steps to Create a Kubernetes Cluster with Minikube

1. **Install Minikube**: Follow the instructions [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) to install Minikube on your system.

2. **Start Minikube**: Open your terminal and run the following command to start Minikube:

   ```bash
   minikube start

   Verify Cluster: Check the status of your cluster to ensure it's running:

```bash

kubectl cluster-info
This command should display information about your Kubernetes cluster, confirming it's running.

Deploy Applications: Now that your cluster is running, you can deploy containerized applications using kubectl commands. For example, to deploy a sample nginx web server:

```bash

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
Access Applications: Expose your deployed application to access it externally:

```bash

kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=NodePort
This command creates a service and exposes it to the external world using NodePort.

Explore Further: Experiment with scaling your application, updating it, and exploring other Kubernetes features using Minikube.

Conclusion
Minikube provides a straightforward way to get started with Kubernetes locally. By following these steps, you can set up and explore Kubernetes clusters on your own machine for development and learning purposes.
